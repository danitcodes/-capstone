#### Setup/Installation Requirements

- To access the live page visit ... TODO

##### Running the Project Locally

###### For Mac Users

- Access Terminal in your Finder, and open a new window. Install the package manager, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), on your device by entering this line of code in Terminal: `$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`.
- Ensure Homebrew packages are run with this line of code: `echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile`.
- Once homebrew is installed, install Git, a version control system for code writers, with this line of code `brew install git`.
- Now, install Node.js through Homebrew with the following command: `brew install node`.
- Confirm that node and npm (Node's package manager that is automatically installed alongside Node) are on your working system with two command lines `node -v` & `npm -v`, respectively returning something resembling `v14.5.0` & `6.14.5` (or higher).

###### For Windows Users

- Open a new Command Prompt window by typing "Cmd" in your computer's search bar.
- Determine whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows by following these [instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running).
- Go to [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), click on the "Download" button, and download the corresponding exe file from the Git for Windows site._
- Follow the instructions in the set up menu.

###### For Both Mac & Windows systems

- Once you have Git installed on your computer, go to this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/danitcodes/-capstone), click the "Fork" button in the upper right hand corner of the page, and clone this application with the following command:`git clone https://github.com/danitcodes/-capstone.git`.
- Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the appropriate source code for your Windows operating system.
- Once the project has been cloned to your computer and you have all the necessary items on your local computer, open the project in the application of your choice.

##### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

###### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

###### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

###### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


###### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
