#### Setup/Installation Requirements

- To access the live page visit ... TODO

#### Running the Project Locally

###### For Mac Users

- Access Terminal in your Finder, and open a new window.
- Install the package manager in the Terminal, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), on your device by entering this line of code:
`$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`.
- Once homebrew is installed, install Git, a version control system for code writers, with this line of code: `brew install git`.
- Now, install Node.js through Homebrew with the following command: `brew install node`.
- Confirm that node and npm (Node's package manager that is automatically installed alongside Node) are on your working system with two command lines `node -v` & `npm -v`, respectively returning something resembling `v14.5.0` & `6.14.5` (or higher).

###### For Windows Users

- Open a new Command Prompt window by typing "Cmd" in your computer's search bar.
- Determine whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows by following these [instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running).
- Go to [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), click on the "Download" button, and download the corresponding exe file from the Git for Windows site.
- Follow the instructions in the set up menu.
- Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the appropriate source code for your Windows operating system.

###### Cloning the Project

- Go to this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dani-t-codes/capstone) and click the green 'Code' button.
![Green Code Button](src/components/img/code-button.png)
- In your CLI, after navigating to the Desktop with `cd Desktop`, clone this application with the following command:`git clone https://github.com/dani-t-codes/capstone.git`.
- (Optional) If you would like to save your own copy to your GitHub account, click the "Fork" button in the upper right hand corner of the main repository page.
- Navigate to the folder 'capstone' from your CLI with the command `cd capstone`.
- Open the project in the code editing application of your choice, like VS Code, by running the command `code .`.

##### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

###### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

###### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

###### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

###### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
