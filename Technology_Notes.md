# Technology Notes for Planning Phase

## Next.js (E-commerce opt)

Pros:

- High performance
- Fast out of the box
- Scalability
  - Performance analytics
- Image optimization
- Internalization (built-in domain & subdomain routing, auto language detection)
- Fast refresh
- Built in CSS & Sass support
- Optimized bundle splitting algorithm created by Google Chrome team
- API routes for backend functionality
- Vercel platform is easiest for deployment (developed by Next.js creators) - FREE
- Can be deployed to any hosting provider that support Node.js too though
- Pages feature
- Authentication for (stretch) user accounts

## Crystallize (Headless e-commerce - compatible with Next.js)

Ref: [Crystallize](https://crystallize.com/learn/developer-guides)

Pros:

- Super fast & scalable
- Bring your own front-end
- **Slack community for developer Q's
- Free tier would work for my purposes
- Crystallize has this whole built GraphQL API for order intake and fulfillment.

## Vercel (all the things and deployment)

See [account](https://vercel.com/danitcodes/tiki-ecommerce)

- Getting a little too deep for the purposes of this project, but there it is anyways.

## Mobile App Mockup Options

- Framer (I think is affiliated with framer motion animations!)
- Proto.io

Both have built-in micro-animations capabilities and look smoother than Fluid, that I used for team week, or some of the other more wieldy options like XD.
